simple weight based:
--------------------
-game adjusts its strategy based on previous games, storing the data in a text file "WeightsDatabase"<br>
-weight based implementation from https://github.com/Mateo-S/Tic-Tac-Toe-ML.git<br>

supervised learning: TODO
--------------------
-4 layers of neural networks looking for patterns<br>
--first layer<br>
---final winning move<br>
--second layer<br>
---opponent's final winning move<br>
--third layer<br>
---best possible move<br>
--fourth layer<br>
---classification of board position before move<br>

reinforcement learning - back propagation:  TODO
------------------------------------------
-same as supervised learning and<br> 
-game results back propagation<br>
--remembers important moves of a win<br>

reinforcement learning - winning probability:  TODO
---------------------------------------------
-same as supervised learning and<br> 
-check every possible moves<br>
--predict winner<br>
